## The Classification Problem

* Given a thing with attributes, assign a class to the thing

* Examples:

  * Given the length of three sides, is it
    equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or not a triangle?
    (Glenford Meyers, *The Art Of Software Testing*)
  * Given an email message, is it ham or spam?
  * Given a book, which author wrote it?
  * Given a recording, what instrument is playing?

* This is a really fundamental AI problemâ€¦

* Closely associated with machine learning
