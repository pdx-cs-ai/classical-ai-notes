## A*

* Super-cool search technique

* Not *too* hard to implement

## Better Search In Sliding Tile Puzzles

* See the course notes on Sliding Tile Puzzles

* http://github.com/pdx-cs-ai/slider

* Brute-force methods don't help much for 15-puzzle

* Heuristic search using A* gets there

## Debugging AI

* 5-hour epic debugging session

* Rewrote DFS because Python hates recursion

* Fixed a bunch of bugs

* Getting DFID right is tricky

* Techniques

    * Testing is key

    * Understanding invariants is key

    * Never gonna be sure

## Another Heuristic

* Let's add "human-search" to `slider.py`

* Does looser heuristic really hurt A*?
