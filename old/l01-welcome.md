## Welcome To CS 441/541

* 10-week course on Artificial Intelligence

* Tendency toward "classical" / "foundational" AI

* Some machine learning

## Hybrid Course

* Hybrid learning is a bit different

* We will try to make it work as well as possible

## Me

* CS PhD from U. Oregon Computational Intelligence Research
  Lab 1999

* Big interests are state-space search in games (single and
  multiplayer), scheduling, planning, etc

## This Course

* Let's review the syllabusâ€¦

* Goal is to prepare 

## A Course For 4th+Year Computer Scientists

* You are expected to be able to write decent code coming
  in

* You are expected to be comfortable with algorithms,
  discrete math, logic and calculus

* If you are fairly uncomfortable with these, go
  fix that first

## What We Won't Be Doing

* Philosophy of AI. We will really concentrate on practice
  over theory

* AI woo. We will concentrate on proven theories you can use
  to consistently produce practical results
