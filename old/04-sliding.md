## Combinatorial State Spaces

* Consider a sliding tile puzzle: what is the state space?

    * State is particular puzzle configuration

    * Neighbors are states reachable by moving one tile:
      each state has 2-4 neighbors (corner, edge, central)

* For an *n Ã— n* puzzle, how many states? *n^2!* (Only half
  are reachable because parity.)

* How big is this graph?

        2 2.40e1
        3 3.63e5
        4 2.09e13
        5 1.55e25
        6 3.72e41
        7 6.08e62

* Won't be examining them all (or half of them)

## Search Strategies

* Keyed off some questions

    * How big is the space?

    * Need a best solution or just a good one?

    * Willing to use heuristics?

    * Need guarantees on solution (quality, existence)?

## Stupid Search

* One could build a sliding-tile puzzle solver the dumb way

* Walk the state space randomly until we run into the answer

## Stop Lists

* Avoid revisiting old states

* Use a *stop list* / *closed list* / *tabu list* of states
  we've already visited

    * Actually sets, not lists, but hey

    * There will be a lot: memory is a problem

## Sliding Tile Puzzles: Complete Search

* Rather than running around randomly, want a solver that is
  guaranteed to

    * Return a shortest solution if one exists (unlike humans)

    * Say "no" otherwise

* Given sufficient time and memory, of course

* Obvious choices:

    * Breadth-first search the state space

    * Depth-first search the state space
