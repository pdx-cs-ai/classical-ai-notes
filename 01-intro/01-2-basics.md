## Thinking About AI: Yahtzee

* [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) is a
  simple multi-player probabilistic dice
  [game](https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/)

* I have built a single-player solver for this game:
  we will talk about that later

* How do humans play Yahtzee?

* How do humans *learn* to play Yahtzee?

## Thinking About AI: Shut The Box

* [Shut The Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box)
  is a simple multi-player probabilistic dice
  [game](http://www.shut-the-box.net)

* I have built a single-player solver for this game:
  we will talk about that later

* How do humans play Shut The Box?

* What does this have in common with Yahtzee?

## Thinking About AI: Chimpanzees and Octopuses

* Surely chimps are "smart"?

* Chimpanzees and the "[tube trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXgxJtuff5U&list=PLEsTbas16YW4Jm9H8W9IcFvT2NpYzS7jE)"
  problem

* [Octopus intelligence](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/how-the-freaky-octopus-can-help-us-understand-the-human-brain/)

* What does this tell us about, well anything about AI?

## Thinking About AI: Language

* Conversational AI

* The [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)

* The [Loebner Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize)

* Are systems that are "intelligent" but entirely *inhuman*
  actually intelligent, or is this a misnomer?

## Definitions of AI

* Reaching intellectual goals in the presence of
  intellectual obstacles

* Thinking and acting like a human

* Solving practical instances of NP-hard problems

* Things that a human can do that a computer
  can't (yet)

## Key AI Issues

* Representation

* Computational constraints
  * Memory
  * Computation time

* Evaluation / validation

## AI Defined Operationally: Areas Of Study

* Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

* Heuristic and Rule-Based Systems

* State-Space Search

    * Single-Agent Search
        * Complete search
        * Local search
        * Constraint Satisfaction

    * Adversary Search

    * Planning and Scheduling

* Machine Learning

* Nature-inspired Systems

* Applications

* *Philosophy??* (*Ex Machina*)

## How To Study AI

* Read things (that aren't even assignments)

  * Grab the latest AAAI proceedings and skim it

  * Find a good tutorial book in an area of particular
    interest

* Build things (that aren't even assignments)

  * Develop intuition for what works and doesn't â€” the "too
    many ideas problem"
    
  * Develop skills in system building and evaluation

* Specialize. General AI is too much; pick a technology or
  domain and focus on that for a while
