# Classical AI Course Notes
Bart Massey 2023

These are the ongoing course notes for my version of
Portland State University's CS 441/541 Intro AI. This is a
"classical" AI course. While there is some coverage of
machine learning, there is more coverage for other AI
methods. State-space search is a particular emphasis, given
my background and interest in this technique.

The numbered subdirectories correspond to weeks of my
current course. The `old/` subdirectory contains old notes
in rough order: much of this is duplicate.
