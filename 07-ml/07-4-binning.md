## Continuous Features Are A Bit Harder

* Enumerating a discrete space is easier than
  measuring a continuous space

* So, would like to convert a continuous feature to a
  discrete one
  
## Discretization

* Uniform binning
  * May take a lot of bins to produce distinctions
  * Still may have to deal with out-of-range cases

* Variable-width bins
  * How to calculate? Can be expensive
  * Kind of wants to be done "offline"

* How many bins to make?

* Iteration is training: watch for overfit
